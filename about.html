		<p>The BTS Rankings aim to provide an objective and broad-scoped system of ranking the UK's shooters, from top athletes on the British Shooting Talent programmes, to County shooters competing at their County Championships.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="rankings">
		<p>The BTS Ranking system is built on an implementation of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo Rating system</a>, originally devised for Chess Tournaments. A shooting match can be thought of not as a single competition but as a series of matches in which each competitor shoots against every other competitor. This approach allows a match to be reduced to a series of one-on-one matches through which the performance of competitors can be compared. A competitor who has finished 5th in a field of 10 shooters has effectively lost 4 matches and won 5.</p>
		<p>The use of the Elo system means there is no need to artificially designate competitions as being in specific tiers or worth a specific number of points. The Ratings value of the competition is inherently defined by the Ratings of the competitors who enter it. This also allows the system to maintain stability in the face of some domestic athletes who may shoot many matches within the UK, versus elite athletes who shoot relatively few domestic matches due to their international commitments. As those elite athletes are expected to win or finish highly in the (fewer) domestic events they do enter, they will maintain a Rating higher than that of athletes who compete in <i>more</i> rateable UK events, but who do not finish as highly at the highest level events.</p>
		<p>As Ratings are individual, mixed or separated events can be catered for equally. A shooter's Rating is not tied to a specific Ranking. They earn their Rating at competitions, and the Rating is used to compile monthly Rankings. Prone Ratings could be used to generate an Overall Prone Rifle Ranking for instance, or Men and Women can be selectively listed into Gender-Specific Rankings.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="criteria">
		<p>The nature of the Elo system means the system really only cares about relative performance in a match - not absolute scores. As a result, it is not reliant on a specific score structure (e.g. ISSF Decimal Scoring). Most Air gun and 3-Positional Rifle matches conform to an ISSF Structure, regardless of whether they use Decimal or Integer scoring. However, for Rankings purposes Men and Women can compete freely in gender-specific or mixed 3x20 or 3x40 events, or 40- or 60-shot Air matches. Prone Ratings are more tricky as the UK has two significantly different competing systems - the ISSF PR60 event (shot at 50metres), and the Dewar system encompassing a variety of match formats at two distances.</p>
		<p><h3>Criteria for Inclusion</h3></p>
		<p><h4>Air Rifle & Pistol</h4>Any <em>Open</em> Precision 10 Metre Air Rifle or Air Pistol event run to NSRA or ISSF rules in the UK with more than 15 competitors.</p>
		<p>Sample Air events: British Airgun Championships; Surrey Air Open; North Wales Airgun Championships; Welsh Airgun; Scottish Open AR Championships; Scottish Open AP Championships; Geoff Partridge Memorial Shoot; BPC Championships.</p>
		<p><h4>3-Positional Rifle</h4>Any <em>Open</em> 3P event run to NSRA or ISSF rules in the UK with more than 5 competitors.</p>
		<p>Sample 3P events: BFRC Open; ESSU 50M Championships; British 50M Championships</p> 
		<p><h4>Prone Rifle</h4>The Prone Ranking is primarily a 50Metre ranking, including any <em>Open</em> English Match (PR60) with more than 20 competitors. Dewar matches may be included if the number of entries or the standard of competition justifies it (eg. the Earl Roberts), or if there are other exceptional circumstances (e.g. the BUCS Open, providing an introduction to competitive shooting for many students). In "Triple Dewar" events, the 50m Scores alone will be used as a PR60 Match.</p>
		<p>Sample Prone events: BFRC Open; ESSU 50M Championships; Welsh 50M Open; British 50M Championships; Scottish 50M Open; Isle of Man Easter Open; the 50M segment of Appleton Rifle Club's "Metres Open"; Torfaen Open; BUCS Championship; Double English Match at NSRA August Meeting.</p>
		<p>We want to include as many events as possible, as geographically dispersed as possible to get the most complete and accurate ratings available. If you think your event would be eligible then please to drop us a line ahead of time ( and send us a copy of your results after the match. Even if your event is not suited to inclusion as a Rateable match, we'd still like to write about it and publicise it on BTS News!</p>
